  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p class="color">I’m finishing up my Computer Science degree and built this ePortfolio to show what I’ve learned, what I’ve created, and where I plan to go next. Over the course of the program, I developed a strong interest in full stack development. I’ve always liked building things, but I didn’t fully understand how much goes into creating a working app until I actually did it. Everything from brainstorming and wireframing to writing backend logic and connecting it to a real database became part of my workflow. Learning how to manage both the frontend and backend gave me a deeper appreciation for the full development process, and I found that I enjoy thinking through all the layers involved in bringing a project to life.</p>

  <p class="color">A Computer Science program teaches a lot more than just coding. I learned how to think critically about system design, performance, and scalability. In frontend development, that meant understanding user experience, responsiveness, and component structure. On the backend, it meant managing data flow, designing APIs, and applying object-oriented principles in a clean and maintainable way. I became familiar with common patterns like MVC, REST architecture, and how to troubleshoot bugs across the entire stack. There is a difference between writing code that works and writing code that scales, and this program helped me understand how to do both.</p>

  <p class="color">Outside of development, I also learned the value of effective collaboration and communication. Whether I was working in teams, reviewing someone else's code, or presenting my work, I had to practice explaining technical decisions in a way that made sense to others. That might mean simplifying a concept for a non-technical stakeholder or walking a teammate through a difficult section of code. Being able to communicate clearly has made me a stronger developer, especially when working with others who have different levels of technical knowledge.</p>

  <p class="color">On the technical side, I spent a lot of time learning about data structures and algorithms. These weren’t just academic exercises. They helped me write faster, more efficient code and solve problems with less overhead. I implemented search and sort algorithms, worked with stacks, queues, and trees, and practiced breaking problems down into logical steps. I also learned how to evaluate trade-offs in memory and runtime. All of this helped me become more thoughtful about how I approach coding challenges.</p>

  <p class="color">I also gained hands-on experience with software engineering and database design. I learned how to plan a project, manage files in Git, write modular and reusable code, and document it properly. In my database courses, I worked with relational models, normalized schemas, and practiced writing complex queries that could support real-world use cases. I saw how a well-structured database can make or break the efficiency of an application.</p>

  <p class="color">Security was another important theme throughout the program. I didn’t just learn how to build things. I learned how to build them safely. I practiced input validation, studied authentication and authorization models, and learned how to minimize vulnerabilities from the ground up. Thinking about security early in the design process became part of how I plan any feature now.</p>

  <p class="color">Putting together this portfolio gave me the chance to reflect on how all of these skills fit together. From working in teams and communicating ideas clearly to writing algorithms and building secure, functional software, I’ve gained experience across the full stack. This process helped me see how each layer of development is connected and how thoughtful planning makes the final product stronger and easier to maintain.</p>

    <h2>Capstone Project: EZ Inventory Mobile App</h2>
    <p class="color">
      This is an Android-based inventory management mobile application built during my time at Southern New Hampshire University. This app is designed for small teams or individuals who need to track items, quantities, and updates in an integrated system. The app includes secure login, search functionality, and real-time database integration using Firebase.

    <div id="review">
      <h3>Code Review</h3>
        <p class="color">This code review focuses on the original version of my EZ Inventory mobile app before any enhancements were applied. As part of my capstone experience, I took a closer look at how the app functioned, where it could be improved, and how I could evolve it to meet real-world standards in software design, algorithmic logic, and database architecture.</p>

        <p class="color">Although this was my first formal code review, the process helped me better understand how developers evaluate their own work and collaborate effectively within a team. By walking through each component of my code — from UI handling to data access — I was able to identify areas like missing comments, errors with user feedback messages, and performance gaps that could be improved with thoughtful enhancements.</p>

        <p class="color">This review breaks the application into three core areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="color"><strong>Software Design & Engineering</strong> – focused on login security and user role management</li>
            <li class="color"><strong>Algorithms & Data Structures</strong> – focused on usability improvements like low-stock alerts and search logic</li>
            <li class="color"><strong>Databases</strong> – focused on transitioning from local Room storage to a cloud-based Firebase Firestore setup</li>
          </ul>
