  <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
  <p>This ePortfolio was built to show what I’ve learned and what I’ve created during my time as a Computer Science major, and how I plan to take what I have gained over the years and apply it to my future career endeavors. Over the course of my time in school, I have gained experience in various technologies on the front end and back end of applications. With that said I have developed a strong interest in full stack development. I’ve always liked building things, but I didn’t fully understand how much went into creating a working app until I actually did it. Everything from brainstorming and wireframing to writing backend logic and connecting it to a real database became part of my workflow. Learning how to manage both the frontend and backend gave me a deeper appreciation for the full development process, and I found that I enjoy thinking through all the layers involved in bringing a project to life.</p>

  <p>A Computer Science program teaches a lot more than just coding. Some of the most useful information I have learned is how to think critically about system design, performance, and scalability. In frontend development, that meant understanding user experience, responsiveness, and component structure. On the backend, it meant managing data flow, designing APIs, and applying object-oriented principles in a clean and maintainable way. I became familiar with common patterns like MVC, REST architecture, and how to troubleshoot bugs across the entire stack. There is a difference between writing code that works and writing code that scales, and this program helped me understand how to do both.</p>

  <p>Outside of development, I also learned the value of effective collaboration and communication. Whether I was working in teams, reviewing someone else's code, or presenting my work, I had to practice explaining technical decisions in a way that made sense to others. That might mean simplifying a concept for a non-technical stakeholder or walking a teammate through a difficult section of code. Being able to communicate clearly has made me a stronger developer, especially when working with others who have different levels of technical knowledge.</p>

  <p>On the technical side, I spent a lot of time learning about data structures and algorithms. These weren’t just academic exercises. They helped me write faster, more efficient code and solve problems with less overhead. I implemented search and sort algorithms, worked with stacks, queues, and trees, and practiced breaking problems down into logical steps. I also learned how to evaluate trade-offs in memory and runtime. All of this helped me become more thoughtful about how I approach coding challenges.</p>

  <p>I also gained hands-on experience with software engineering and database design. I learned how to plan a project, manage files in Git, write modular and reusable code, and document it properly. In my database courses, I worked with relational models, normalized schemas, and practiced writing complex queries that could support real-world use cases. I saw how a well-structured database can make or break the efficiency of an application.</p>

  <p>Security was another important theme throughout the program. I didn’t just learn how to build things. I learned how to build them safely. I practiced input validation, studied authentication and authorization models, and learned how to minimize vulnerabilities from the ground up. Thinking about security early in the design process became part of how I plan any feature now.</p>

  <p>Putting together this portfolio gave me the chance to reflect on how all of these skills fit together. From working in teams and communicating ideas clearly to writing algorithms and building secure, functional software, I’ve gained experience across the full stack. This process helped me see how each layer of development is connected and how thoughtful planning makes the final product stronger and easier to maintain.</p>

    <h2>Capstone Project: EZ Inventory Mobile App</h2>
    <p>
      This is an Android-based inventory management mobile application built during my time at Southern New Hampshire University. This app is designed for small teams or individuals who need to track items, quantities, and updates in an integrated system. The app includes secure login, search functionality, and real-time database integration using Firebase.

    <!-- CODE REVIEW -->
    <div id="review">
      <h3>Code Review</h3>
        <p>This code review focuses on the original version of my EZ Inventory mobile app before any enhancements were applied. As part of my capstone experience, I took a closer look at how the app functioned, where it could be improved, and how I could evolve it to meet real-world standards in software design, algorithmic logic, and database architecture.</p>

        <p>Although this was my first formal code review, the process helped me better understand how developers evaluate their own work and collaborate effectively within a team. By walking through each component of my code — from UI handling to data access — I was able to identify areas like missing comments, errors with user feedback messages, and performance gaps that could be improved with thoughtful enhancements.</p>

        <p>This review breaks the application into three core areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Software Design & Engineering</strong> – focused on login security and user role management</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithms & Data Structures</strong> – focused on usability improvements like search functionality and filtering logic</li>
            <li><strong>Databases</strong> – focused on transitioning from local Room storage to a cloud-based Firebase Firestore setup</li>
          </ul>

<!-- SOFTWARE DESIGN -->
<div id="design">
  <h3>Software Design & Engineering</h3>
  <p>
    For my first enhancement, I focused on improving the security and structure of the EZ Inventory app by adding role-based access. In the original version, there was no login system and no way to control who could do what in the app—anyone who opened it could add, edit, or delete inventory items. That obviously wouldn’t work in a real-world situation, so I implemented Firebase Authentication and set up logic to separate admin users from regular users. Only admins can make changes to the inventory, while regular users can log in and just view items. I chose to include this enhancement because it shows my understanding of secure design and how to structure an app in a way that accounts for different user roles. It also demonstrates my ability to work with external tools like Firebase and apply them in a meaningful way. This enhancement supports a few key course outcomes like developing a security mindset, using well-established tools in computing, and adapting UI behavior for different audiences. One of the trickier parts of this enhancement was making sure role data passed correctly between screens and that only the right options showed up in the menu for each role. That challenge taught me how much attention to detail is required when building secure, user-aware software.

<!-- ALGORITHMS -->
<div id="algorithms">
  <h3>Algorithms & Data Structures</h3>
  <p>
    The second enhancement I made was all about improving how users interact with the inventory list. At first, the app just displayed a long scrollable list of items with no way to filter or flag important ones. That might be okay with a small inventory, but it quickly becomes a pain when you have more items to deal with. So, I added a real-time search bar that filters items as the user types, and I also implemented a low-stock alert that highlights any items with a quantity below five. These changes not only make the app easier to use, but they also demonstrate my ability to apply algorithmic thinking and work with data structures effectively. I selected this part of the app for enhancement because it gave me the chance to practice working with lists, dynamic filtering, and UI responsiveness—all skills that tie directly to the course outcome about algorithms and design trade-offs. While the logic itself wasn’t extremely complex, I had to make sure that the list updated efficiently and didn’t lag when users typed into the search bar. Figuring that out helped me better understand the relationship between data and UI performance. Overall, this enhancement is a great example of how small algorithmic changes can lead to a much better user experience.

<!-- DATABASE -->
<div id="database">
  <h3>Databases</h3>
  <p>
    The last enhancement I made was replacing the local Room database with Firebase Firestore, which was probably the most impactful change in terms of scalability. Originally, the app used Room to store inventory data on the device itself. That worked fine for local testing, but it came with big limitations—data couldn’t be accessed across devices, and everything was lost if the app was uninstalled. To fix that, I migrated the entire inventory system to Firebase Firestore. This allowed me to store data in the cloud and made it accessible in real time from any device with an internet connection. I included this enhancement because it shows my ability to take a working prototype and push it toward a more realistic, production-ready state. It connects strongly to course outcomes like using modern tools and techniques in computing, supporting collaborative environments, and building systems that provide long-term value. I had to completely rewrite the logic for adding, editing, and deleting items to use Firestore’s API, and I also had to restructure my item model to match the way Firestore stores data. One of the challenges was making sure the UI stayed responsive and nothing broke during the switch, but once everything clicked, I felt way more confident working with cloud databases. This enhancement really pulled together everything I learned throughout the course.
